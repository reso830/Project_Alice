# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `createApp({ repositories })` now throws a clear `'createApp: repositories is required'` error when called bare, instead of letting the destructure surface a cryptic `TypeError`. Carried over from the PR #23 self-review (INFO).
- `docs/REPO_MAP.md` row descriptions for the 019 and 020 spec packages now reflect the actual artifact contents (plan scope, contract scope, quickstart scope). Carried over from the PR #30 self-review (INFO).

### Fixed

- Audit timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `lastStatusUpdate`) now reflect the user's **local** timezone at the moment of the write rather than the server's timezone. The client sends its local `YYYY-MM-DD` in a new `X-Client-Date` request header; the server validates it and threads the value through routes → repository wrappers → SQLite/Supabase adapters. Direct API consumers (curl, scripts) that omit the header fall back to UTC, which also unifies SQLite-mode and hosted-mode behavior. Closes [#43](https://github.com/reso830/Project_Alice/issues/43).
- Application overlay now reverts the header background, status badge, and the dropdown's seeded status when a user discards an unsaved status change. Previously the underlying draft was restored but the header chrome and the `currentStatus` closure used by the status dropdown remained stuck on the rejected status, so the overlay looked "stuck" on the new status until reopened. Closes [#35](https://github.com/reso830/Project_Alice/issues/35).

## [0.13.2] — 2026-05-25

Calendar v3 patch — Phase 13 re-smoke follow-ups plus the long-deferred collapsible Action Panel summary bar. Same feature surface as v0.13.0; no API or schema changes.

### Added

- **Collapsible Action Panel summary bar** at every stacked layout (`<1200px` — narrow desktop, tablet portrait, mobile). The full panel collapses by default into a single-row summary (`"Today · N events · N suggestions · N upcoming"` or `"Quiet day — nothing on your plate"` when all sections are empty); tap, click, Enter, or Space toggles. Esc collapses from inside the expanded panel. Returns the calendar grid to the top of the viewport at narrow widths instead of pushing it below several hundred pixels of stacked content.
  (026-calendar §11.1)
- **Shared `QuickFiltersStatusPopup` component.** Tracker and Calendar now mount the same status-filter popup across every breakpoint; one chrome, one behavior, no parallel implementations.
  (026-calendar §6.12)
- Local SQLite + demo seeds now include at least one day with 4+ distinct statuses so the `+N` overflow chip on month grid cells is exercisable out of the box.
  (026-calendar)

### Changed

- Calendar status filter retired the `.filter-dd` dropdown chrome. The filter icon button now opens the shared Tracker popup with single-select semantics on the Calendar side.
  (026-calendar)
- Inline Day Panel row meta is now `{Company} · {Job title}` (was Company only) — mirrors the Action Panel meta pattern (`§6.3` separator treatment) so the two surfaces feel cohesive.
  (026-calendar §17.5)
- Month grid header allows a controlled two-row wrap below 375px (iPhone SE / Galaxy Z Fold cover-screen class): nav cluster on row 1, `[Today*] [Filter*]` on row 2. Above 375px the single-row rule still holds.
  (026-calendar §6.6.1 + §11)
- Calendar status badge inside the Inline Day Panel switched from DM Mono to Sora — matches the page typography per `§4`.
  (026-calendar)
- DayPanel group-header dashed rule renders as an inline hairline next to the status badge instead of an unintended full extra row.
  (026-calendar)
- Action Panel ID pill now matches the Tracker ID pill treatment (font / padding / radius unified).
  (026-calendar)
- Out-of-month weekend cells render with the out-of-month weekend tint (`#F7F3EC`) instead of the in-month weekend tint that was previously winning the cascade.
  (026-calendar §6.8)
- Selected cell border ring restored — navy ring by default, indigo when the selected cell is also today.
  (026-calendar §17.3)

### Fixed

- **Picker anchoring on desktop / tablet.** Resolves the `[0.13.1] § Known limitations` entry. Month, Year, and Status filter popups now sit directly under their trigger buttons on every viewport above mobile bottom-sheet widths.

### Removed

- `src/components/calendar/StatusFilterDropdown.js` and its tests — superseded by the shared `QuickFiltersStatusPopup`. No remaining call sites.
  (026-calendar)

## [0.13.1] — 2026-05-25

Calendar v2 patch — design polish + inline Day Details Panel pivot driven by the v0.13.0 browser smoke. Same feature surface; no API or schema changes.

### Added

- **Inline Day Details Panel** below the Month Grid. Selecting a date keeps both the grid and the day's activity in view; replaces the previous popover for both desktop and mobile.
  (026-calendar §17)
- "Suggestion dismissed" toast on the Action Panel dismiss button — earlier the row exited silently.
  (026-calendar)
- Profile-name injection in the greeting (`"Good morning, Alice"` when a profile is set; no trailing comma otherwise).
  (026-calendar)
- Status filter is now a 30×30 icon button (funnel glyph idle, status swatch when active) mirroring the Tracker quick-filter control; same on desktop and mobile.
  (026-calendar)

### Changed

- Renamed the `assessment` status display label `Technical Assessment` → `Technical` globally. The status key is unchanged; no migration required. Affects Calendar chips, Tracker badges, filter dropdowns, and all status pill surfaces.
  (026-calendar)
- Month Grid cells are now keyboard-selectable whether or not they have activity (`Enter` / `Space` activate); numbered chips and `+N` overflow chips became decorative (no `role`, no tab stop). Day-detail interaction routes through the cell, not the chip.
  (026-calendar)
- Month and Year buttons in the grid header now render as text-style triggers (no border, no `▾` caret) and stay on a single row at every breakpoint, including mobile (retired the prior 3-row mobile header).
  (026-calendar)
- Status filter now dims **all** non-matching cells — including empty days — so the matching set is the only thing at full opacity.
  (026-calendar)
- Picker headers dropped the "Jump to month" / "Jump to year" labels; the Year picker's range header now uses the same Sora weight as the year buttons (no font mixing).
  (026-calendar)
- CW gutter cells gained `aria-hidden="true"` and a `Week N, {year}` tooltip so screen readers skip them while sighted users still get the year context at boundary weeks.
  (026-calendar)
- CSS polish: section subheaders/count pills sized up; DOW labels, CW numbers, day numbers, and the "Rest of week" label switched to weight 500 (no longer bold); `.cal-empty` lost its dashed border + brown tint; weekend / out-of-month hues distinguishable against the in-month white. Calendar ID pill matches the Tracker's ID treatment.
  (026-calendar)

### Removed

- `src/components/calendar/DayPopover.js` and its tests — superseded by the Inline Day Details Panel. No remaining call sites.
  (026-calendar)

### Known limitations

- **Picker anchoring on desktop/tablet (obs #5 carryover).** Month, Year, and Status filter dropdowns can still drift off their trigger in the live browser on some viewports. JSDOM positioning math is correct (regression test added in `tests/components/calendar/anchoredDropdown.test.js`), so the cause is browser-only (likely ancestor `transform` or `overflow`). Tracked for a future patch; mobile bottom-sheet behavior is unaffected.
  - _Resolved in [0.13.2](#0132--2026-05-25)._

## [0.13.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Calendar page** — new dedicated view alongside the Tracker and Profile pages.
  (026-calendar)
- Action Panel with Today, Suggested Actions, and Upcoming sections; count pills;
  five rule-based suggestion kinds (follow-up, feedback, interview follow-up, offer
  expiry, ghost flag).
  (026-calendar)
- Month Grid with always-6-week layout, ISO Monday-start, calendar-week gutter,
  status-coloured numbered chips, +N overflow, out-of-month and weekend tints, and
  today highlighting.
  (026-calendar)
- Status filter chip + dropdown; month/year navigation arrows; Month and Year
  pickers; Today button; Day Popover (status-mode and all-mode).
  (026-calendar)
- Mark Ghosted action from suggestion rows — updates status + Timeline entry in one
  step with a confirmation toast.
  (026-calendar)
- Local dismissal of suggestion rows; demo-mode dismissals stay in memory only
  (never touch localStorage).
  (026-calendar)
- Calendar suggestion-coverage assertions added to `tests/seed-data.test.js`.
  (026-calendar)

> **Operator action required (hosted only):** apply the updated
> `claim_and_seed_starter()` RPC body from
> [`docs/db/claim_and_seed_starter.md`](docs/db/claim_and_seed_starter.md) (v3)
> so new hosted users see a Calendar follow-up suggestion on day 1. Existing users
> are unaffected.
> See `specs/026-calendar/quickstart.md §4` for the full operator checklist.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- Application Timeline section in the detail overlay: collapsed preview,
  inline add/edit/delete, future-dated entries, and automatic Timeline
  entries when status changes.
  (025-application-timeline)
- Seeded Timeline content in the local SQLite DB seed, in-browser demo
  seed, and hosted starter applications.
  (025-application-timeline)

### Changed

- Replaced the visible *Last Updated* row in the application detail
  overlay with the Timeline preview. The underlying `lastStatusUpdate`
  field is still stored and bumped for status changes.
  (025-application-timeline)
- Modal max-height now clamps at 860px so tall Timelines scroll inside
  the modal body while the header and footer remain pinned.
  (025-application-timeline)
- `claim_and_seed_starter()` RPC body updated to seed Timeline content
  for new hosted users.
  (025-application-timeline)

### Removed

- Removed the visible *Last Updated* row from the application detail
  overlay. No data was removed.
  (025-application-timeline)

### Fixed

- Timeline normalization now preserves an explicit empty array
  (`timeline: []`) instead of re-synthesizing entries on every read.
  Previously, a user who deleted every Timeline entry and saved would
  see the entries reappear after the modal received the server's
  response. Synthesis now runs only when the `timeline` field is
  absent from the input record.
  (025-application-timeline)

## [0.11.1] — 2026-05-20

> Documentation polish release — feature 022-deployment-polish-docs.
> Consolidated hosted-deployment operator surface (README refresh +
> `docs/deployment.md` expansion + new `docs/hosted-smoke-test.md`).
> No runtime, schema, endpoint, or dependency changes. Only code
> touch is the in-app `APP_VERSION` literal keeping pace with
> `package.json` per constitution Amendment 1.3.0.

### Docs

- Refreshed README "Hosted Mode" section: three runtime modes
  (local / hosted / demo) summarised in one place, with pointers to
  the consolidated operator surface in `docs/deployment.md`.
  (022-deployment-polish-docs)
- Expanded `docs/deployment.md` with four new sections:
  **Environment Variable Checklist** (deployer pass/fail framing
  alongside the existing Reference table), **Supabase Setup
  Checklist** (one ordered procedure consolidating features 018 +
  019 quickstarts plus an explicit RLS-policy verification step),
  **Demo & Free-Tier Notes** (Vercel Hobby cold starts, Supabase
  Free pause, demo reset, hosted seeded data), and
  **Migration Clarification** (local SQLite does not migrate to
  hosted; migration tooling is future work).
  (022-deployment-polish-docs)
- Added `docs/hosted-smoke-test.md` — standalone Given/When/Then
  smoke-test checklist for pre-promotion hosted verification.
  Seven sections: login, demo, CRUD, profile editing, cross-user
  authorization (RLS-scoped 404 check with proper Bearer-token
  fetch), resume-import restrictions, and 375px mobile layout.
  (022-deployment-polish-docs)
- `docs/REPO_MAP.md`: added a `## Docs` section cataloguing
  `AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`, `deployment.md`, `hosted-smoke-test.md`,
  and `REPO_MAP.md`; added Spec Packages rows for
  `specs/022-deployment-polish-docs/`.
  (022-deployment-polish-docs)

### Changed

- `APP_VERSION` literal bumped to `'v0.11.1'` in
  `src/pages/welcome/shared/appMeta.js` to stay in sync with
  `package.json` per constitution Amendment 1.3.0 (in-app version
  display in lockstep with SemVer).
  (022-deployment-polish-docs)

## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-20

> Hosted resume import security release — feature 021-hosted-resume-import-security.
> Pure security hardening + regression guards on the existing
> `POST /api/resume/parse` endpoint. No new endpoints or env vars. The
> user-observable delta is a sanitized error code for corrupted files;
> everything else is invariant-pinning plus a serverless PDF runtime shim.

### Added
- `PARSE_FAILED` error code for `POST /api/resume/parse` — returned
  when the file parser throws (corrupted PDF, malformed DOCX,
  empty/garbled file). The response is
  `400 { error: { code: 'PARSE_FAILED', message: 'Could not read this resume. Try a different file.' } }`.
  The raw library error is logged server-side via
  `console.error('[resume.parse]', { error, stack, nameSha8, mimetype, path })`
  with an 8-char SHA-256 prefix of the filename (not the raw filename)
  and the request path; the resume content and the raw filename are
  never logged.
- `specs/021-hosted-resume-import-security/contracts/api.md` —
  canonical post-021 security model for the parse endpoint:
  threat model, four-layer defense (frontend demo gate → server
  auth → multer validation → parser validation), explicit guarantees
  (`§4.1` auth required, `§4.2` no disk write, `§4.3` no Supabase
  persistence, `§4.5` fixed error code set, `§4.7` service-role-key
  unreachable), and explicit non-guarantees (no malware scan, no
  rate limiting, global 500 handler unchanged).

### Changed
- Pre-021, corrupted-file uploads fell through `next(error)` to the
  global 500 handler at `server/index.js:74-91`, which echoed
  `err.message` — exposing library internals (`pdf-parse` stack text,
  `mammoth` ZIP error strings, internal paths) to the client. The
  new resume-route catch sanitizes the response. The global 500
  handler is unchanged for every other route.
- Every non-`LIMIT_FILE_SIZE` `multer.MulterError`
  (`LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE`, `LIMIT_FIELD_KEY`, `LIMIT_FIELD_VALUE`,
  `LIMIT_FIELD_COUNT`, `LIMIT_FILE_COUNT`, `LIMIT_PART_COUNT`) is
  now mapped to `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` with the raw multer message
  logged server-side — closing FR-007's "no client-shape error
  reaches the global 500 handler" guarantee.
- PDF extraction now installs `DOMMatrix`, `ImageData`, and `Path2D`
  globals from `@napi-rs/canvas` before loading `pdf-parse`, and
  points PDF.js at `pdf-parse`'s embedded data-URL worker instead of
  the default `./pdf.worker.mjs` path. Valid PDFs now parse in
  Vercel's Node/serverless runtime even when browser canvas globals
  and untraced worker files are absent. `@napi-rs/canvas` was already
  present transitively via `pdf-parse`; it is now direct so the
  runtime shim is explicit.

### Internal
- New regression guards in `tests/server/resume.test.js` —
  `describe('resume API — hosted auth gate (FR-001, FR-009)')`
  (2 cases) pins the hosted unauthenticated → 401 contract;
  `describe('resume API — in-memory invariant (FR-002, FR-010)')`
  (5 cases) installs pass-through `fs.write*` / `fs.open*` /
  `fs.promises.*` spies and asserts zero write-mode calls across
  happy + four failure paths;
  `describe('resume API — service-role credential isolation (FR-012)')`
  (5 cases) reads each resume-code-path file and asserts neither
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` nor `service_role` appears.
- New corrupted-file + log-shape + FR-007 sweep tests in the same
  file pin the new `PARSE_FAILED` mapping, the sanitized response
  body (no `pdf-parse`/`pdfjs`/`mammoth`/`node_modules` substrings),
  and the sanitized log object (`nameSha8` / `mimetype` / `path`
  present, raw filename absent).
- Added 18 new tests across the three new describe blocks plus the
  corrupted-file, log-shape, FR-007 sweep, and `LIMIT_UNEXPECTED_FILE`
  cases, including a valid-PDF regression with DOM canvas globals
  deleted and the embedded PDF worker selected.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-19

> Portfolio demo mode release — feature 020-portfolio-demo-mode.
> A purely client-side, in-memory demo of the tracker is now reachable
> from the welcome page's "Try the demo" CTA. Local SQLite and hosted
> Supabase modes are unchanged. The reserved `APP_RUNTIME=demo` slot
> from 019 is removed; setting it now fails at boot.

### Added
- Portfolio demo mode — public visitors can click **Try the demo** on
  the welcome page (or the auth-modal's demo button) to explore the
  tracker and profile with 23 seeded sample applications and a fully
  populated demo persona (Alex Rivera). Application date and
  `lastStatusUpdate` are shifted at session start so the most recent
  record reads as "today" while preserving relative spacing. Profile
  biographical dates remain static. Demo state lives in module-level
  memory only and resets on every browser refresh (FR-005); no API
  calls, no `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, IndexedDB, or cookie
  writes occur during a demo session
- `'demo'` auth status — `src/data/authStore.js` gains `DEMO_STATUS`,
  `enterDemo()`, and `exitDemo()`; `init()` has no demo restore path
  (refresh ends the demo by design)
- In-memory demo data layer — `src/data/demoStore.js` provides the same
  CRUD surface as the network adapter (`getAll` / `getById` / `create`
  / `update` / `archive` / `getProfile` / `saveProfile` / `loadSeed` /
  `clear`) with deep-cloned reads, validation reused from
  `src/models/application.js` and `src/models/profile.js`, and the
  standard `{ code, message, fields? }` error shape; `src/data/demoSeed.js`
  exposes `buildDemoSeed()` returning a fresh applications + profile
  pair
- Side-effect-free SQLite seed modules — `server/seeds/applicationsData.js`
  and `server/seeds/profileData.js` expose `DEMO_RECORDS` and
  `DEMO_PROFILE` as pure constants so the demo's parity tests can
  assert byte-for-byte equivalence with the SQLite seed without
  opening the database or calling `process.exit`
- Service-layer mode switch — `src/services/api.js` short-circuits all
  seven exported functions to `demoStore` when `getAuthState().status
  === 'demo'`, never touching the network in demo; `src/services/resumeApi.js`
  throws `{ code: 'DEMO_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE' }` immediately in demo
- Navbar Demo affordance — `src/components/Navbar.js` renders a
  "Demo mode" badge and an **Exit demo** button (door-arrow icon
  matching the sign-out button) when status is `'demo'`; clicking the
  button calls `authStore.exitDemo()` and toasts "Exited demo"
- ProfileEdit inline note — `src/pages/ProfileEdit.js` renders a small
  `.profile-edit__resume-demo-note` element ("Resume import is
  available after signing in.") in the resume-import slot when in
  demo, replacing the upload widget
- Design-by-contract guard — `src/components/ResumeImport.js` promotes
  its previously internal `VISIBLE_STATUSES` set to an export; a test
  asserts `!VISIBLE_STATUSES.has(DEMO_STATUS)` so a future change that
  silently adds `'demo'` to the set fails immediately
- Test coverage — `tests/data/{demoStore,authStore.demo}.test.js`,
  `tests/services/{api,resumeApi}.demo.test.js`,
  `tests/pages/welcome/demoStub.test.js`,
  `tests/components/{Navbar.demo,ResumeImport.demo}.test.js`,
  `tests/pages/ProfileEdit.demo.test.js` — including a fetch spy that
  asserts zero network calls across every demo write

### Changed
- Server-side runtime config now accepts only `local` and `hosted` —
  the reserved `'demo'` slot from 019 has been removed. Setting
  `APP_RUNTIME=demo` now fails at boot with the standard
  `Invalid APP_RUNTIME` error naming the two valid values. The
  `DemoRepositoryNotImplementedError` class, the `createDemoStub`
  factory, the dispatcher's demo branch, and the
  `config.isDemo` short-circuit in `assertHostedSchema` are deleted
- Welcome CTA wiring — `src/pages/welcome/demoStub.js` no longer fires
  a "Demo coming soon" toast. It now exports `enterDemo()` which
  delegates to `authStore.enterDemo()`. The welcome page CTA and the
  auth-modal demo button both call through this entry
- `src/main.js` routes `'demo'` status to the app shell alongside
  `'local-mode'` and `'authenticated'`, and skips the legacy
  `src/data/store.js` `localStorage` warm-up entirely in demo
- `src/pages/Tracker.js` gates both `persistFilterState` and
  `loadPersistedFilterState` on `status !== 'demo'` so demo sessions
  perform zero `localStorage` writes under `apptracker_filters` and
  start from default filter state regardless of any prior signed-in
  session's persisted prefs

### Internal
- The legacy `server/db-seed.js` and `server/db-seed-profile.js`
  scripts now import their data constants from the new
  `server/seeds/*.js` modules; `db-seed-profile.js` additionally
  guards its top-level side effects (`initSchema` / `saveProfile` /
  `process.exit`) behind an `import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href`
  CLI check matching the pattern `db-seed.js` already uses

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-17

> Hosted persistence release — feature 019-supabase-persistence.
> Local SQLite mode is byte-equivalent to v0.8.1 and remains the default.
> Hosted operators MUST apply the migration in
> [`specs/019-supabase-persistence/data-model.md §5`](specs/019-supabase-persistence/data-model.md)
> before deploying a v0.9.0+ build to hosted mode; the boot check refuses
> to serve until the migration is in place.

### Added
- Supabase-backed repository adapters for `applications` and `profile` —
  every read scopes by the caller's `user_id` via both server-side
  `.eq('user_id', userId)` filters and Supabase Row Level Security
  (defense in depth, FR-016)
- `user_seed_state` marker table + `claim_and_seed_starter()` RPC — first
  authenticated API call from a hosted user atomically seeds 2 sample
  applications and a starter-state marker inside one Postgres transaction;
  empty profile is intentional onboarding (FR-012, FR-013, FR-014)
- `demo` runtime mode added as a third `APP_RUNTIME` value (alongside
  `local` and `hosted`) — currently returns
  `DemoRepositoryNotImplementedError` on every method; reserved for
  feature 020
- Per-request Supabase client factory
  ([server/repositories/supabase/client.js](server/repositories/supabase/client.js))
  — constructs an anon-key client carrying the caller's JWT so PostgREST
  applies RLS as the authenticated user; never reads
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` at runtime
- Boot-time hosted schema check
  ([server/health.js](server/health.js)) — sentinel PostgREST probes
  against `applications`, `profile`, `user_seed_state` refuse to start
  the server until the 019 migration is applied
- `attachRepos(dispatcher)` Express middleware
  ([server/repositories/middleware.js](server/repositories/middleware.js))
  — sets `req.repos = dispatcher.forRequest(req)` so route handlers have
  one uniform contract across all three runtime modes
- `seedHostedUserIfNeeded` Express middleware
  ([server/auth/seedHostedUser.js](server/auth/seedHostedUser.js))
  — runs after `requireAuth` on every protected hosted route, invoking
  the seed RPC exactly once per user
- `server/db/columns.js` — shared module exporting column lists, the
  `FIELD_TO_COLUMN` map, `toRow`/`toRecord` translators, and SQLite-side
  helpers. Both the SQLite and Supabase adapters consume it so they
  cannot drift; backward-compat re-exports preserve existing imports
  from [server/db/applications.js](server/db/applications.js)

### Changed
- `createRepositories(config)` now returns a uniform
  `{ forRequest(req) }` shape across all three runtimes (local, hosted,
  demo). Route handlers obtain their per-request repository bundle via
  `req.repositories.forRequest(req)`. Hosted mode constructs a per-
  request RLS-scoped Supabase client; local and demo return long-lived
  bundles. Route factories now receive `{ repos, requireAuth,
  seedHostedUserIfNeeded }` instead of pre-extracted `{ repo, requireAuth }`.
- All protected route handlers converted to `async` with explicit `await`
  on every repository call — the Supabase adapter returns Promises and
  the status-transition check in `PATCH /api/applications/:id` cannot
  function without `await` (forbidden transitions would silently slip
  through validation)
- `api/index.js` (Vercel hosted entry) now passes `config` +
  lazy-imported `seedHostedUserIfNeeded` to `createApp`, fixing two
  pre-existing latent gaps (hosted Vercel runtime had not been
  receiving auth/seed middleware)
- Adapter shape (`ApplicationsRepository` / `ProfileRepository`) method
  names + arguments unchanged; only return type changed from sync values
  to Promises (route handlers add `await` to existing call sites)

### Dependencies
- `@supabase/supabase-js` (added in 018 for the frontend bundle) is now
  also used **server-side** to construct per-request RLS-scoped clients.
  No new package install required; the existing dependency is reused at
  the Node runtime. Verify with `npm ls @supabase/supabase-js`.

### Migration required
- Hosted operators MUST apply
  [`data-model.md §5`](specs/019-supabase-persistence/data-model.md) via
  Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor before deploying v0.9.0+ to hosted
  mode. The block is idempotent (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS + DROP
  POLICY IF EXISTS) and safe to re-run. Pre-019 hosted data is wiped per
  018's *Accepted Limitations* — though in practice 017's hosted schema
  was documented but never applied so most projects have nothing to
  wipe.
- The boot check in
  [server/health.js](server/health.js) refuses to start the hosted
  server if the migration has not been applied; expect a descriptive
  startup error naming the missing column or table.

### Security
- Per-user ownership enforced by RLS + server-side filters on every
  hosted read and write. Cross-user access attempts return responses
  indistinguishable from "resource does not exist" — no information
  leak via differential status codes or response bodies.
- Verified end-to-end against a live multi-tenant Supabase project
  during Task 08.2 manual smoke (quickstart §6 RLS direct-bypass):
  user A's JWT against user B's row id returned `[]` from both Express
  (404) and direct PostgREST calls — both server-side filter and RLS
  policy independently refused.

### Local mode (unchanged)
- SQLite repositories and schema are byte-equivalent to v0.8.1. Local
  developer workflow (`npm run server:dev` + `npm run dev`) requires
  no setup changes. Existing local data is untouched.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-17

> UI polish release on top of v0.8.0 — no API, schema, or auth-behavior
> changes. Bundles the Tracker chrome refresh (feature 018 Phase 13) and the
> full Welcome refresh (Phases 14–18).

### Changed
- Tracker top bar restyled to a unified navy band (52px sticky) with brand cluster, page nav, and right-aligned identity cluster
- Email truncation switched from JS char-count to CSS `max-width` (full email always in the `title` attribute); `EMAIL_DISPLAY_LIMIT` and `truncateEmail()` retired from `Navbar.js`
- Sign-out button restyled with a door-arrow icon; collapses to icon-only at `≤ 639px`
- Mobile chrome (`≤ 639px`) gains a bottom tab bar (`src/components/BottomTabBar.js`) for page nav and a floating "+ New application" button (`src/components/Fab.js`) above it
- Fold-narrow breakpoint (`< 380px`) hides the "Project Alice" wordmark while keeping the logo mark + sign-out icon
- Tracker toolbar flipped onto the navy band with refreshed filter chip / count badge / erase-all tints (`design/tracker.md` § Toolbar-on-navy tints)
- Welcome page rewritten to match `design/welcome_page.md` — headline accent `<em>organized.</em>` with indigo underline-glow, theme-driven brand mark; the previous floating metadata pills + "Sample data" disclaimer are no longer rendered
- Welcome mini footer sourced from a new shared `src/pages/welcome/shared/appMeta.js` (`APP_VERSION`, `ISSUE_URL`, `LICENSE_NAME`, `LICENSE_URL`) — single source of truth shared with `Footer.js`; license set to `PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0`
- Hero slideshow replaced — the six product-screenshot slides (`src/assets/welcome-hero/*.png`) and their imports are gone; the new cycler shows four animated scenes (`SceneStack`, `ScenePipeline`, `SceneProfile`, `SceneLogo` in `src/pages/welcome/scenes/`), 5500ms per scene, 700ms cross-fade, dot navigation with a per-scene progress bar; all motion gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- Welcome page now ships fixed production defaults for layout, theme, copy intensity, and hero scene — the prototype Tweaks panel and `?key=value` URL overrides were prototyped during Phase 16 but cut before merge; responsive desktop / tablet / mobile branches remain
- Auth modal restyled per design §4.6 — 440px / 14px-radius shell, `rgba(8,8,24,.55)` overlay with 6px backdrop blur, 40px header logo, footer with primary submit → "or" divider → demo button (warm fill, green pulse dot) → swap-mode link → legal copy on signup only; the previous tab strip is replaced by the in-footer swap link
- Welcome `<760px` portrait stack lands inside the same `WelcomePage.js` module via a JS-toggled `.welcome--mobile` class; full-width CTAs with pulsing green dot on the demo button; brand mark forced to `Alice_Colored.png` regardless of theme
- Resize-driven viewport crossings mount/unmount the hero slideshow so the DOM matches the active branch (mobile omits it; desktop/tablet keep it)
- "Try the demo" CTA (welcome page + auth modal) now fires a shared "Demo coming soon" toast via `src/pages/welcome/demoStub.js` — `window.alert()` no longer used; real demo behavior owned by a future feature
- Test coverage extended in `tests/components/{bottomTabBar,fab}.test.js`, `tests/pages/welcome/heroSlideshow.test.js`, and `tests/pages/welcome/scenes/*.test.js`

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-16

### Added
- Hosted authenticated user access via Supabase email/password — feature 018-auth-user-access; local mode is unchanged and remains the default
- `allowed_emails` table + `auth.users` `BEFORE INSERT` trigger — operator-managed allowlist enforced inside Postgres so unauthorized signups never reach `auth.users`
- `server/auth/middleware.js` — `createRequireAuth({ jwksUri, logger })` factory; verifies `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` against Supabase's JWKS endpoint (`<SUPABASE_URL>/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`) via `jose.jwtVerify`, accepting `ES256` and `RS256` (Supabase's modern asymmetric signing modes); logs categorized rejections (`missing | malformed | expired | signature | other`) with redacted-path context, never the token
- `/api/health` now returns `{ status, runtime: 'local' | 'hosted' }` so the frontend can detect a runtime/config mismatch
- `createApp({ repositories, config, requireAuth? })` — `server/index.js` factory now accepts an optional `requireAuth`; hosted mode throws if `supabase.jwtSecret` is missing and no explicit `requireAuth` is passed
- `logBoot(config)` — single-line `[runtime] mode=<runtime> port=<port>` entry so operators can grep the active mode in production logs
- `src/services/supabaseClient.js` — Supabase JS client wrapper; reads `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_AUTH_EMAIL_REDIRECT_URL`; exports `isHostedAuthAvailable`
- `src/data/authStore.js` — module-state subscribable auth store with `init`, `subscribe`, `getAuthState`, `getAccessToken`, `signOut`; states: `initializing | local-mode | unauthenticated | authenticated`
- `src/services/healthApi.js` — `getHealth()` standalone fetcher returning the raw `{ status, runtime }` envelope (does not go through `request()`'s `data` unwrap)
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` automatically attached by `src/services/api.js` and `src/services/resumeApi.js` whenever `authStore.getAccessToken()` returns a value
- `src/pages/welcome/WelcomePage.js` — diagonal-split landing page with brand block, headline, three CTAs (Sign In, Create Account, Try Demo), floating metadata pills with illustrative disclaimer, footer metadata, and a `?auth=callback` verification banner handler that cleans the URL while preserving other query params
- `src/pages/welcome/HeroSlideshow.js` — 5-second auto-rotating screenshot slideshow, single static slide under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- `src/pages/welcome/AuthOverlay.js` — centered-modal overlay with `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal`, tab strip with login/signup switching, focus trap, ESC + backdrop + close-button dismissal, previous-focus restoration, `verification_sent` state, `dispose()` cleanup path used by parent unmount
- `src/pages/welcome/LoginForm.js` — email/password login form with neutral error copy and accessible inline loading state (`aria-busy`, mirrored `aria-live` status)
- `src/pages/welcome/SignupForm.js` — email/password signup with inline field validation (email regex, password min 8), neutral signup-rejection error (never leaks the cause), and `onSuccess` → overlay transitions to `verification_sent`
- `src/pages/ConfigError.js` — operator-facing fallback page; mounted when the hosted runtime handshake (`getHealth()` returns `runtime: 'hosted'` but `isHostedAuthAvailable` is false) detects missing Vite env vars
- `bootstrap()` + `runtimeHandshake()` exports in `src/main.js` — runtime handshake now runs BEFORE `authStore.subscribe` / `init`, so a misconfigured hosted deploy never flashes the welcome page or app shell before ConfigError replaces it
- `Navbar` user segment — email (truncated past 24 chars with full value in `title`) + Sign Out button; hidden in `local-mode` and `unauthenticated`; `Navbar.destroy()` unsubscribes from `authStore`
- `ResumeImport.create()` subscribes to `authStore` and toggles `root.hidden` based on auth state — gated to `local-mode` / `authenticated` only
- Welcome + auth overlay + ConfigError CSS in `src/styles/main.css` — diagonal-split layout (55% content / 62% hero anchored right with the design's clip-path), responsive breakpoints (≥1100px / 760–1100px / <760px / <420px), reduced-motion media query disabling card transforms and overlay entrance
- Six hero screenshots in `src/assets/welcome-hero/` (`tracker`, `application-modal`, `profile`, `filters`, `calendar`, `mobile-tracker`)
- Vite build-time assertion (`assertHostedFrontendEnv`) — production builds fail closed when any of `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_AUTH_EMAIL_REDIRECT_URL` is missing
- `@supabase/supabase-js` (^2.45.0) and `jose` (^6.x) dependencies
- Spec package at `specs/018-auth-user-access/` — `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/api.md`, `research.md`, `quickstart.md`, `checklists/plan-review.md`
- `design/welcome_page.md` — visual specification for the welcome experience
- Test suites: `tests/server/auth-middleware.test.js`, `tests/server/routes-protected.test.js`, `tests/data/authStore.test.js`, `tests/services/{supabaseClient,healthApi,resumeApi}.test.js`, `tests/components/{welcome,heroSlideshow,navbar,resumeImport}.test.js`, `tests/pages/configError.test.js`, `tests/main.test.js`, `tests/build/vite-config.test.js`

### Changed
- `createApp()` signature now `({ repositories, config, requireAuth? })`; route factories (`createApplicationsRouter`, `createProfileRouter`, `createResumeRouter`) likewise accept `{ repo, requireAuth }`
- `unmountAppShell` in `src/main.js` calls `Navbar.destroy()` to clean up the auth-store subscription on transitions back to the welcome page
- `ResumeImport.create()` always returns an element; visibility now driven by `root.hidden` from a subscription, with completion state tracked separately so post-import hiding survives auth-state transitions

### Security
- Allowlist enforcement lives in a Postgres `SECURITY DEFINER` trigger on `auth.users` — an Express endpoint approach was considered and rejected because it could be bypassed by direct Supabase calls from the browser
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only — never appears in `src/` or in the Vite production bundle (verified in Phase 12)
- JWT verification pins `['ES256', 'RS256']` algorithm allowlist explicitly to defeat `alg: none` and downgrade attacks
- No long-lived shared HS256 secret is configured anywhere; signing key material is fetched at runtime from the Supabase-managed JWKS endpoint
- Token contents are never logged; categorized rejection logs include `category` and request path only

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- Resume Import — upload a PDF, DOCX, or TXT resume from the Profile page; extracted text is parsed and mapped into profile fields; the Edit Profile page opens pre-filled for review before the user decides to save; no automatic profile saving occurs
- `POST /api/resume/parse` — multipart upload endpoint; enforces a 5 MB size limit; dispatches to `pdf-parse` (PDF) or `mammoth` (DOCX) for text extraction; regex-based section and field parser extracts structured profile data
- `server/resume/extractor.js` — file-type dispatcher for PDF and DOCX text extraction
- `server/resume/parser.js` — regex and pattern-based parser; maps section headings and field patterns to typed profile field shapes
- `src/components/ResumeImport.js` — drag-and-drop upload component with idle, uploading, success, and error states; accessible file-input fallback
- `src/services/resumeApi.js` — frontend API client for the resume parse endpoint
- `mergeResumeIntoProfile()` in `src/models/profile.js` — non-destructive merge of AI-extracted fields into an existing profile; existing non-empty fields are never overwritten
- `mammoth` and `pdf-parse` server dependencies for document text extraction
- Test suites for resume parsing (`tests/server/resumeParser.test.js`), API routes (`tests/server/resume.test.js`), and profile merge logic (`tests/models/resumeMerge.test.js`)
- `LICENSE` — PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0; Copyright 2026 Alvin

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- Inline edit modal — click any field in the detail view to edit it in place; outside-click commits the change to draft; Esc reverts the field without committing; Cmd/Ctrl+S saves; Cmd/Ctrl+Enter commits a multi-line field
- Create mode — `+ New application` button opens an empty draft modal with status defaulting to Wishlisted; saving creates the record and switches the modal to edit mode; Archive button hidden in create mode; footer always visible
- Draft management — footer appears when any field differs from the saved record; Save and Discard buttons; discard confirmation guard on ✕, backdrop click, and Esc; Favorite and Archive bypass the draft
- Six new optional application fields: `location` (free text), `shift` (Day/Mid/Night/Flexible), `workSetup` (Remote/Hybrid/On-site/Field), `compatNotes` (rich notes alongside the compatibility bar), `generalNotes` (free-text notes), `preferredSkills` (chip editor, separate from required skills)
- Quick filters toolbar — filter the card list by Status, Salary range (₱50k–₱250k dual-handle slider), Compatibility range (0–100 dual-handle slider), Company, Favorites, Shift, Work Setup, and Location; multiple filters stack with AND logic; subheader label switches to "Results" when any filter is active; erase-all button clears all filters at once
- "(Not set)" option in Shift, Work Setup, and Location filter panels — matches applications where that field is empty or null
- Sort panel — sort by Job ID, Status, Compatibility, Salary, or Company in ascending or descending order; Restore default resets to Job ID ascending
- Filter state persists to `localStorage` (key `apptracker_filters`) and is restored on page load; invalid enum values stripped on restore; location strings kept as-is; sort state is session-only
- Empty-filter state — "No applications match the active filters." shown in place of the card list when active filters return zero results
- Required field visual indicators (asterisk `*`) on job title, company name, and responsibilities fields within the overlay
- `parseSalaryInput()` and `formatSalaryDisplay()` utilities in `src/utils/currency.js` — parse user-entered peso amounts from formatted strings; format integers for display
- `scripts/ai-flow.ps1` — PowerShell orchestrator for a two-agent AI pipeline (Claude + Codex) with hard gates at each stage; includes `run-all` action to loop through all phases automatically
- `scripts/prompts/` — nine prompt templates covering the full pipeline: specify, plan, tasks, spec review, requirements check, phase implementation, phase review, and PR review (Claude and Codex variants)
- `docs/AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` — full reference for the local AI workflow: actions, gate system, log locations, recovery flows, and FAQ
- `docs/REPO_MAP.md` — codebase navigation shortcut for AI-assisted implementation; covers pages, components, backend, utilities, key boundaries, and common change patterns
- `features/` directory with example feature brief template
- `.gitignore` entries for AI workflow state files (`specs/**/.ai-phase`, `specs/**/.ai-requirements-ready`, `specs/**/.ai-phase-*-review`)

### Changed
- `responsibilities` field promoted to required — must be non-empty on Save and Create; existing records retain their stored value but validation is enforced on all new saves
- Detail modal header background is now the status `borderAccent` color (not `--navy`); header text color resolves to white or black based on relative-luminance contrast
- Status change in the modal now routes through the draft — the header color and badge update immediately but the `lastStatusUpdate` date is not written until Save
- DB schema auto-migrates — six new nullable columns (`location`, `shift`, `work_setup`, `compat_notes`, `general_notes`, `preferred_skills`) are added via `ensureColumn` on server start; existing records are unaffected
- `db:seed` updated — demo records include representative values for all new fields (shift, workSetup, location, compatNotes, generalNotes, preferredSkills)
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` updated to reflect implemented app state (Vite/Express/SQLite), constitution v1.0.1, required date field (`lastStatusUpdate`), and correct directory conventions (`.agents/skills/` as shared source; `.codex/` lowercase for Codex-specific state)

### Fixed
- Newline characters in multi-line fields (responsibilities, compatibility notes, general notes) now render as visual line breaks in display mode instead of collapsing to a single line
- Sort popup no longer clips above the visible viewport when opened while the page is scrolled down on desktop
- Overlay quick action buttons now show exactly one tooltip via the `title` attribute; duplicate `aria-label` removed to prevent double-tooltip in some browsers
- Chip editor (Required Skills, Preferred Skills) no longer throws JavaScript errors when Enter keydown and blur fire simultaneously — a `_committingByEnter` flag prevents concurrent DOM re-renders
- Long text and URLs in the overlay no longer overflow their containers on narrow viewports — `overflow-wrap: break-word` applied
- Status pill in the overlay header remains legible on very narrow viewports (≤320px) — text centered when wrapped to two lines
- Salary field now displays "–" instead of blank when no value is set, consistent with all other optional text fields
- Modal discard in create mode no longer no-ops — `_attemptDiscardDraft()` now calls `close()` directly when `_mode === 'create'` instead of falling through the null guard
- `Find-SpeckitSpecDir` now resolves the requested feature name before falling back to the current branch, preventing misrouting when `-FeatureName` differs from the active branch
- Removed silent latest-spec fallback in `Find-SpeckitSpecDir`; unresolved names now throw immediately

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- Overlay-based add and edit flows for all six structured profile sections — Experience, Education, Certifications, Awards, Languages, and Links; modal on desktop (≥ 640 px), bottom-sheet on mobile with fly-in animation; overlay includes focus trap, ESC dismiss, and backdrop-click cancel
- Skills staging overlay — skills are staged as pills inside the overlay and merged into the main form only on Save; case-insensitive duplicate deduplication
- Discard confirmation inside overlays — "Discard entry changes?" with a red Discard button appears when cancelling a dirty overlay; ESC and backdrop click route through the same flow
- Edit icon on each structured entry row — opens a pre-filled overlay; saving updates the entry in-place without adding a duplicate
- Structured display for Certifications on the View Profile page — name, issuing body, date range, and optional Certificate ID rendered in a hierarchy matching the Education section
- Structured display for Awards on the View Profile page — award name, issuing body and date as meta, details paragraph below
- `validateYear` — four-digit year validator (≥ 1900) applied to Education's Year Completed field in both the overlay form and `validateProfile`
- `beforeunload` guard on the Edit Profile page — triggers the browser's native "Leave site?" dialog when there are unsaved changes

### Changed
- Edit Profile section order now matches View Profile: Basic Info → Summary → Experience → Education → Skills → Certifications → Awards → Languages → Links
- All structured entry sections use a title/meta/desc hierarchy with dedicated Edit and Remove icon buttons; "Add" button moved to the section header with primary styling
- Edit overlay saves use card-local re-render instead of full page rebuild, preventing scroll position reset on every entry edit
- Overlay form fields have consistent 14 px gap between fields
- Discard button styled red (`#c1121f`) across both the overlay discard dialog and the page-level discard modal
- iPad Mini stat chip layout — `.apps-desktop-vis__stats .stat-chip-row` overrides to a 2 × 2 grid, preventing chip overflow at 768 px

### Fixed
- Education Year Completed now validates year format in addition to required-field check
- Remove icon on the main skills card now uses `×` (was ASCII `x`)
- `.entry-row__edit` CSS now uses `var(--color-accent)` directly; undefined `--accent` fallback removed
- Awards entry no longer passes an empty string to the display helper when details are absent

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- Profile Edit page — full rewrite from section-by-section placeholder to a centralized inline editor with global Save/Cancel controls, dirty-state tracking, and a discard confirmation modal (keyboard-accessible, scroll-locked backdrop)
- Sticky subheader bar on the Edit Profile page — "Edit Profile" title with Save and Cancel buttons always visible without scrolling; Cancel triggers the discard flow; no separate back button
- Navbar discard guard — clicking any nav bar link while unsaved changes exist shows the discard confirmation modal before navigation proceeds
- Inline add/remove flows for all seven list-based profile sections: Skills (pill tags, case-insensitive duplicate deduplication, Enter key shortcut), Languages (language + proficiency dropdown), Certifications, Education (sorted newest-first by year), Professional Experience (sorted current-first then by end date), Links (URL validation, safe-protocol enforcement), Awards
- One-at-a-time inline form constraint — opening a second section's form while one is already open has no effect; Save is blocked and shows a persistent inline error (not a toast) while any form is open
- Structured entry data model — Experience, Education, Certifications, Awards, Languages, and Links now stored as typed entry objects instead of plain strings; backward-compatible normaliser migrates old string-array profiles on first read
- Client-side validation for all entry types: required fields, MM/YYYY date format, URL protocol enforcement, email format; errors surfaced inline below the relevant field before save; section-level summary shown if migrated entries have unfilled required fields
- Server-side validation for all structured entry fields via extended `validateProfile`; server returns `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` on invalid entries
- Required field visual indicators — red asterisk appended to all required field labels throughout the editor
- Inline form two-column row layouts — Language (language + proficiency), Certification (issuance date + expiry date), Experience (date started + date ended + current work checkbox) on viewports ≥ 640 px
- Experience Date Ended field disabled and dimmed when Current Work is checked; re-enabled and required when unchecked
- Compact icon remove button on all list entry rows (26 × 26 px, accessible `aria-label`, red hover state)
- Section header navy accent color on the Edit Profile page
- `src/utils/validate.js` — `validateRequired`, `validateMonthYear`, `validateUrl`, `validateEmail` pure validators
- `src/utils/sort.js` — `sortEducation` (by year completed descending) and `sortExperience` (current roles first, then by end date descending, then by start date)
- `src/utils/url.js` — `getSafeExternalHref` extracted and shared by Profile and ProfileEdit pages

### Changed
- Profile page updated to render new structured entry shapes: `responsibilities`/`dateStarted`/`currentWork` for experience; `degreeMajor`/`university`/`yearCompleted` for education; certifications, awards, languages, and links rendered as objects
- `src/models/profile.js` extended with per-type entry normalisers and comprehensive `validateProfile` covering all entry-level required fields; `PROFICIENCY_LEVELS` exported
- `certifications[].issuingBody` is now required (was previously optional); profiles with a blank issuing body will fail validation at save, prompting the user to update before saving

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- Profile page — welcome header personalised with first name, application stats (total, active, pending, offer) with an interactive donut chart and collapsible legend, and a full profile card with collapsible subsections (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Languages, Certifications, Awards, Links)
- Profile edit page — section-by-section editing; each card saves independently using a read-merge-write pattern so unedited fields are never overwritten
- `GET /api/profile` and `PUT /api/profile` — SQLite-backed profile persistence; profile stored as a single JSON record
- `server/db/profile.js` — profile repository with UPSERT logic
- `server/routes/profile.js` — `createProfileRouter()` factory matching the existing applications router pattern
- `src/models/profile.js` — `validateProfile`, `normaliseProfile`, `computeAppCounts`, `computeStats`, `STATUS_COLORS`, `STATUS_LABELS`
- `src/components/DonutChart.js` — SVG donut chart with per-segment hover tooltips; Largest Remainder Method for exact integer percentages; degenerate 100% case handled as two arcs to avoid invalid SVG paths
- `src/components/StackedBar.js` — horizontal proportional bar with tap-to-label interaction for mobile
- Responsive chart layout — desktop shows donut + legend, mobile shows stacked bar + tap labels; both always in DOM, toggled via CSS `@media`
- Collapsible profile subsections — expanded on desktop, collapsible on mobile via `.is-collapsed` class toggle
- XSS-safe external link rendering — only `http:`/`https:` hrefs are passed through; `javascript:` and all other schemes fall back to `#`
- `npm run db:seed:profile` — populate the profile table with demo data
- `npm run db:clear:profile` — clear the profile table (returns the profile page to the no-profile state)
- Server integration tests for the profile API (`tests/server/profile.test.js`)
- Page-level tests for the Profile page (`tests/pages/Profile.test.js`)
- Component tests for DonutChart (`tests/components/DonutChart.test.js`)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- Client-side pagination on the application list — visible only when total records exceed 10; 3-page sliding window with first/last anchors and non-clickable ellipsis separators
- Persistent site footer on every page — brand identity, version info, tech stack credits, and feedback links (GitHub Issues)
- `src/utils/pagination.js` — `getPaginationModel()` pure function encapsulating the windowing algorithm
- `src/components/Pagination.js` — page navigation component with full ARIA labelling (`aria-label`, `aria-current="page"`)
- `src/components/Footer.js` — footer component with inline brand SVG, version/stack sections, and feedback links
- `src/assets/` — project logo files (`Alice_White.png`, `Alice_Colored.png`); white variant used in header and footer
- `jsdom` dev dependency for component-level DOM tests
- Page-change behaviour: scrolls to top and moves keyboard focus to the list region
- Page preservation on dataset change: current page retained when still valid; clamped to highest valid page when invalid; reset to 1 when pagination disappears
- Component tests for Pagination and Footer (`tests/components/`)
- `npm run db:seed` — loads 23 demo records covering all 9 statuses (one archived); clears existing data first
- `npm run db:clear` — deletes all rows without touching the schema

### Changed
- Footer and navbar now use `Alice_White.png` logo instead of placeholder SVG/div icons
- Sticky footer layout: `body` uses flex column with `min-height: 100%`; `#app` takes `flex: 1` to push footer to viewport bottom on short pages
- Footer reflows to 2-column grid on viewports narrower than 640 px

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- SQLite-backed Express REST API (`server/`) replacing `localStorage` as the persistence layer
- `POST /api/applications` — create an application with full validation (Zod)
- `GET /api/applications` — list all non-archived applications
- `GET /api/applications/:id` — fetch a single application (archived records included)
- `PATCH /api/applications/:id` — partial update with status-change tracking (`lastStatusUpdate` bumped only on actual status change)
- `POST /api/applications/:id/archive` — soft-delete via `archived` flag
- `GET /api/health` — liveness probe
- Shared `STATUS_VALUES` constant (`shared/constants.js`) imported by both frontend and backend
- `src/services/api.js` — fetch-based API client with typed error envelopes (`NETWORK_ERROR`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `NOT_FOUND`)
- `npm run db:init` script to initialize or re-initialize the SQLite schema
- `npm run server:dev` / `npm run server:start` scripts
- Integration test suite for all API endpoints (`tests/server/applications.test.js`)
- `makeMemoryDb()` and `makeTestDb()` test helpers for isolated SQLite databases
- GitHub Actions Node.js CI workflow for pushes to `main` and pull requests targeting `main`
- CI test-result generation via `npm run test:ci`, with Vitest JUnit output written under `test-results/vitest/`
- Ignored output directories for local logs and generated test results

### Changed
- Frontend reads (`getAll`, `getById`) and writes (`create`, `update`, `archive`, `fav` toggle) now go through the API instead of `localStorage`
- `src/data/store.js` retained but marked `@deprecated` — no longer the active persistence layer
- Card and modal field references updated to match API names (`jobTitle`, `companyName`, `jobPostingUrl`, `lastStatusUpdate`)
- Lint script now covers `server/` and `shared/` in addition to `src/` and `tests/`
- All system date fields (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `lastStatusUpdate`) stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` (date-only)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- Application tracker UI with card-based list view
- Nine-state status workflow (Wishlist, Applied, Phone Screen, Interview, Technical Assessment, Offer, Rejected, Withdrawn, Ghosted)
- Add and edit forms with required-field validation and URL checking
- Full detail modal with all application fields
